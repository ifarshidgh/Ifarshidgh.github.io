This is Parsa Rangriz. I am currently a senior undergraduate student at the [Department of Physics, Sharif University of Technology](https://physics.sharif.edu).

My research interests:
- Quantum Information Theory
- Quantum Thermodynamics
- Information Theory and Optimization
- Statistical Physics 

Since summer 2021, I am a research intern at the [Department of Physics and Astronomy, The University of Manchester](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/facultiesandschools/department-of-physics--astronomy(6e3f13b0-fa6a-4c9b-b0a1-89e1bbd72e06).html), where I work with [Dr. Ahsan Nazir](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/ahsan.nazir.html) and Dr. Adam Stokes to study thermodynamics of non-conjugate quantum subsystems, based on course-grained entropy.
