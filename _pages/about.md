This is Parsa Rangriz. I am currently a senior undergraduate physics student at the [Sharif University of Technology](https://physics.sharif.edu) (SUT).

My research interests:
- Quantum Information Theory
- Quantum Thermodynamics
- Information Theory and Optimization
- Statistical Physics 

Since summer 2021, I am a research intern at [The University of Manchester](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/facultiesandschools/department-of-physics--astronomy(6e3f13b0-fa6a-4c9b-b0a1-89e1bbd72e06).html), where I work with [Dr. Ahsan Nazir](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/ahsan.nazir.html) and Dr. Adam Stokes to study thermodynamics of non-conjugate quantum subsystems, based on course-grained entropy.

I am part of [Prof. Amir Daneshgar](http://mathsci.sharif.ir/faculties/daneshgar/) research group at the SUT. I do some numerical experiments to evaluate the connectivity of random regular graphs with respect to the min-cut problem.

Besides, I study the sphere packing problem in Hamming space using the loop correction theory of graphical models in the context of cavity method under the supervision of [Dr. Saman Moghimi](http://physics.sharif.ir/~web/saman-moghimi-araghi/) from SUT and [Dr. Abolfazl Ramezanpour](https://sites.google.com/site/abolfazlramezanpour) from the Shiraz University.
